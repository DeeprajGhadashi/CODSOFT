        <h2>A brief summary of Bose's journey</h2>
        <p>Subhash Chandra Bose was born on January 23, 1897, in Cuttack, Orissa, India. He received his early education in Cuttack and later attended Cambridge University in England. Bose joined the Indian National Congress and became a prominent leader advocating for complete independence. He served as the mayor of Calcutta and later formed the Forward Bloc. Bose's early life shaped his strong nationalist ideology and leadership skills, setting the stage for his influential role in India's fight for freedom.</p>
        <p>Bose was deeply influenced by the teachings of Swami Vivekananda . He joined the Indian National Congress (INC) and initially believed in non-violent means of achieving independence. However, he grew disillusioned with the INC's moderate approach and their failure to secure complete independence. Bose then formed the Forward Bloc in 1939, a political group within the INC, advocating for more radical measures to gain freedom. He later resigned from the INC and sought support from Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan during World War II to gain military assistance for India's liberation.</p>
        <p>Subhash Chandra Bose's role in the Azad Hind Fauj (Indian National Army) was instrumental. He formed the INA in 1942, uniting Indian prisoners of war and civilians in Southeast Asia. Bose sought support from the Axis powers, including Germany and Japan, to fight against British rule in India. Under his leadership, the INA participated in military campaigns, notably in the Burma region. The INA's slogan "Jai Hind" became a symbol of resistance. Bose's leadership and vision inspired many Indians to join the cause. Although the INA faced challenges, it raised awareness and garnered international support for India's freedom struggle. Bose's involvement in the Azad Hind Fauj showcased his determination and his unconventional approach to achieving independence.</p>
        <p>However, Bose's alliance with Axis powers, including Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan, remains controversial. Some critics argue that his association compromised India's independence struggle. Bose's death in a plane crash in Taiwan in 1945 further fueled conspiracy theories surrounding his demise, leading to persistent speculation about his survival.</p>
